### HR EMPLOYEE DISTRIBUTION DASHBOARD
This project is the data analysis and visualisation of a Human Resources Dataset. Questions like employee retention rate, gender distribution of employees, work location flexibility of employees, age group distribution, etc. This analysis would help stakeholder to make decisions based on employee retention, training resource allocation, work flexibility and so on.
